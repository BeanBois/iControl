This task relates to decentralised federated learning of 4 moving robots with 4 raspberry pi using Lava framework for SNNs

Firstly, since we dont have access to an actual robot, i will have a computer (laptop1) that runs a simulator of 4 robots using pygym

We will have each rpi be responsible for controlling 1 robot with the Lava framework. 
They will use SNNs with the Lava framework (or even sigma-delta neural network)


then to communicate among the system for federated learning, we perform graph diffusion on the SNNs of the robot. 
We want the diffusion to only diffuse the 'foundation' part of the model. 
In our example, say that we have four 4-legged robots which are paired up to be placed in 2 different terrain (flat or sloppy),  (1)
or maybe we have 2 of 2 different 4-legged robots and for each pair of robot, one is placed in a different terrain (2)

we want to perform graph diffusion such that the sharing of learnt knowledge includes the learnt knowledge from walking, 
and the learnt knowledge from terrain, but not learn knowledge that are dependent on the robot's dimension.

This can be done by using Generalised Measure of Information transfer from paper [https://arxiv.org/abs/1102.1507] , 
We can treat the sharing of terrain knowledge as unique Information for robots from different terrain (since they are unique to each robot);
or treat the sharing of manuevering knowledge for all robots as synergistic information since they may not have perfect knowledge of walking at 
initially and may optimise differently. Terrain knowledge for robots from same environment is also synergistic, since they may not know the environment well. 
knowledge learnt based on robot's dimensionality will be considered redundant knowledge to robots that are different as they are largely irrelevant.


### Solution Design for Decentralized Federated Learning in Multi-Robot SNNs with Lava Framework  
This task involves training four simulated robots (via Pygym) using Raspberry Pis (RPis) with Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) in a decentralized federated learning (FL) setup. The goal is to enable knowledge sharing through **graph diffusion** while isolating terrain-specific, maneuvering, and robot-dimension-dependent knowledge. Below is a structured approach:

---

#### **1. System Architecture and Model Partitioning**  
- **SNN Structure**: Split each robot’s SNN into two parts:  
  - **Foundation Layer**: Shared across robots via graph diffusion. This layer captures *general locomotion knowledge* (e.g., walking patterns, balance control) and *terrain-agnostic features*.  
  - **Specific Layer**: Retained locally to handle robot-specific parameters (e.g., dimensions, actuator dynamics) .  
- **Lava Framework**: Use Lava’s SNN or Sigma-Delta Neural Network (SDNN) libraries for energy-efficient computation on RPis, leveraging SNNs’ sparse communication and event-driven processing .  

---

#### **2. Graph Diffusion for Federated Learning**  
- **Graph Structure**:  
  - Pair robots based on terrain (e.g., two in flat terrain, two in sloped) to form subgraphs.  
  - Use a hybrid graph topology: *intra-terrain edges* for sharing terrain-specific knowledge and *inter-terrain edges* for synergistic maneuvering knowledge .  
- **Knowledge Partitioning via Information Theory**:  
  - **Unique Information** (Terrain-Specific): Apply *Generalized Measure of Information Transfer* to isolate terrain adaptation parameters (e.g., friction handling). Robots in the same terrain group share this uniquely .  
  - **Synergistic Information** (Maneuvering): Diffuse locomotion strategies across all robots, allowing collective optimization of walking patterns (e.g., gait synchronization) .  
  - **Redundant Information** (Robot Dimensions): Mask parameters tied to robot hardware (e.g., leg length, weight) during diffusion .

#### **3. Implementation Workflow**  
1. **Simulation Setup**:  
   - Use Pygym to simulate four robots (two terrain types, two robot designs).  
   - Assign each robot to an RPi running Lava-based SNNs.  
2. **Local Training**:  
   - Robots train locally on terrain-specific tasks (e.g., slope navigation) while updating both foundation and specific layers.  
3. **Graph Diffusion Phase**:  
   - **Intra-Terrain Diffusion**: Share foundation layer parameters within terrain groups (e.g., flat-terrain robots exchange slope adaptation knowledge).  
   - **Global Synergistic Diffusion**: Aggregate maneuvering parameters across all robots using decentralized averaging (e.g., consensus algorithms) .  
4. **Regularization**: Apply gradient masking to exclude dimension-dependent parameters from updates .  

---

#### **4. Addressing Challenges**  
- **Non-IID Data**: Use prototype propagation (from graph FL) to align feature representations across terrains .  
- **Stragglers**: Implement asynchronous aggregation for RPis with computational delays .  
- **Privacy**: Leverage Lava’s event-driven spiking to minimize raw data transmission .  

---

#### **5. Validation Metrics**  
- **Terrain Adaptation Accuracy**: Compare success rates in navigating assigned terrains.  
- **Energy Efficiency**: Measure computational overhead on RPis (SNNs vs. traditional ANNs) .  
- **Convergence Speed**: Track how quickly synergistic knowledge stabilizes across robots .  

---

### **Example Scenario**  
For two robot pairs (flat vs. sloped terrain):  
- **Flat-Terrain Pair**: Diffuse foundation parameters like "steady gait optimization."  
- **Sloped-Terrain Pair**: Share "slope resistance adjustments."  
- **Global Synergy**: All robots contribute to "obstacle avoidance strategies."  
- **Excluded**: Parameters like "leg servo calibration" (robot-specific).  

### **Relevant Tools & References**  
- **Lava Framework**: Supports SNN/SDNN deployment on neuromorphic hardware .  
- **Decentralized FL Frameworks**: Use graph-based aggregation from  and terrain-aware prototypes from .  
- **Information Partitioning**: Apply metrics from  to distinguish unique/synergistic knowledge.  

This approach balances specialization and collaboration, enabling efficient, privacy-preserving FL for heterogeneous robotic systems.
